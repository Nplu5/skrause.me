# How to groupBy in TypeScript

I use TypeScript in all of my projects. In this blog I needed to group all the 'TIL'-articles by
their year. Based on the article of Robin Wieruch on
[How to groupBy in JavaScript](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-groupby/) I created a
TypeScript version of that feature.

Starting with Robins solution (Please check
[his post](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-groupby/) on how he arrived at the given solution)
TypeScript started complaining.

```javascript
const tilByYear = til.reduce((acc, til) => {
  if (!acc[value.year]) {
    acc[value.year] = []
  }

  acc[value.year].push(til)

  return acc
}, {})
```

The problem was that I do not know at transpile time which keys are going to be used. Of course I
could have just listed all possible years but then I would have needed to add a new property every
new year. So I defined a `TilGrouped` type and added it the example as follows:

```javascript
type TilGrouped = {
  [x: string] = Til[]
}

type Til = {
  slug: string,
  title: string,
  content: string
}

const tilByYear = til.reduce((acc: TilGrouped, til) => {
  if (!acc[value.year]) {
    acc[value.year] = []
  }

  acc[value.year].push(til)

  return acc
}, {})
```
